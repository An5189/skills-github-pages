title: Quick Draft Blog Post
date: 2024-07-16
This is a quick draft blog post just to try it out while I'm learning how to use github and build my own site. 
I worked today, they put me training on laser 1. I'm sure it's because of how yesterday went with the bullies 
at woek. I loved it over there. I thoght I liked it in VKM but this was so much better. I did better without people 
rushing me and staying on my ass to hurry when im learning.
